Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. 

The goal of this project is to determine if the first stage will land successfully by leveraging standard Data Science methodologies. With the insight gained from this analysis, we can ultimately determine the cost of a launch.
